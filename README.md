# CSGO-Skin-DB
A tool to create update a database of csgo skins with current market values

Created to populate the market value fields for my tradeup calculator [here](https://github.com/Kalekdan/Tradeup-Buddy). It takes a csv file as an input in the format used by my tradeup calculator. It then replaces any of the value fields with the latest market values as given by the [csgo backpack API](https://csgobackpack.net/api/)
